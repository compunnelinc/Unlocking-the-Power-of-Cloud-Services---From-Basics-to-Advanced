Cloud services are everywhere these days, and they're a big part of both personal and professional life. Whether you're just starting out or have been in the tech world for years, understanding cloud services, cloud service providers, and cloud computing services is important. This guide will break down these topics in a simple way that everyone can understand.

## What Are Cloud Services?

[Cloud services](https://www.compunnel.com/category/enterprise-cloud/) are various services that you can access over the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining your own hardware and software, you can use these services whenever you need them and pay only for what you use.

**Types of Cloud Services**

1.	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtual computing resources like servers and storage. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
2.	Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers tools for developing and running applications. Examples include Heroku, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure App Services.
3.	Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet. Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, and Salesforce.

## Why Choose Cloud Services?

Cloud services have many benefits, making them a popular choice for both individuals and businesses:
